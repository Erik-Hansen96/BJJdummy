# Smart BJJ Dummy Prototype

![Smart BJJ Dummy](https://github.com/Erik-Hansen96/BJJdummy/assets/53250669/2167deca-f9f6-46b0-bfe3-64ee1b79a1e8)

## Overview

This project involves creating a Smart BJJ Dummy for practicing chokes with real-time feedback. Two force sensors simulate carotid arteries and jugular veins, providing a practical training tool.

## Features

- **Force Sensors:** Two sensors mimic carotid arteries and jugular veins.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** After applying sufficient force for 7 seconds on both sides, lights blink to indicate a successful technique.

## To-Do List

1. Acquire a wrestling dummy for implementation.
2. Purchase force sensors with higher sensitivity (current sensors only detect up to 500 grams).
3. Add a buzzer for more immediate feedback instead of just flashing lights.

## Usage

Follow these steps to set up and use the Smart BJJ Dummy:

1. **Assemble:** Place force sensors on the sides of the wrestling dummy's neck.
2. **Practice:** Apply force on both sides for 7 seconds to simulate a successful choke.
3. **Feedback:** Lights will blink to indicate a secured technique.
